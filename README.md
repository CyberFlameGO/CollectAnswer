# CollectAnswer - UWP App

This application was created by Tadeáš Drab (me) as my final project for student program called Student Training Center by Microsoft Slovakia.

**About app**

Its UWP (Universal Windows Platform) application for asking questions and answering to them.

This app was made with an idea based on user privacy. This app does not collect any user data and store them in database.

**Server implementation**
